# Project Proposal

# Introduction:

My project is going to be a game similar to tank trouble. Tank trouble is an online game where two people each control a tank and fight each other using the cannnons on the tank. There is a maze where the players have to navigate through and go to the other player. In addition to the regular cannon there will be a bunch of power ups which spawn across the map which players can pick up. In the online game these power ups give the player other weapons. In addition to extra weapons I plan on adding powerups which change different aspects of the tank such as its movement speed. Tthe game will also include sound. Some background that I have that will help me in this project will be the past MPâ€™s and working on the OpenFrameworks snake game.

# Libraries:

In order to help complete my project I have found two libraries in addition to openFrameworks. One library called Maxillian is a C++ Audio and Music Library which I will use for all the sounds in the game. According to their git repository it also works well with OpenFrameworks. The other library is called box2d and specifically I plan on using ofxBox2d which is an OpenFramworks wrapper for box2d. Box2d is a 2d physics engine for games and has many feature such as collision detection which should be helpful for my game.
